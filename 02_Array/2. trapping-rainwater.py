# Time complexity O(n)
# Space complexity O(1)

# Water units trapped in each index of the array is calculated and added individually.
# Water level at an index is determined by the lower of max_left and max_right for any bar,i.e. essentially water trapped in bar i depends on min(max_left, right_left).
# Water trapped in index i = min(max_left, max_right) - height[i].
# Therefore if max_left < max_right, we fill the left index up to max_left, and advance the left pointer; and vice versa. If max_left equals max_right, moving either pointer would work.

class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
        if len(height)<= 2:
            return 0
        
        ans = 0
        
        #using two pointers i and j on indices 1 and n-1
        i = 1
        j = len(height) - 1
        
        #initialising leftmax to the leftmost bar and rightmax to the rightmost bar
        lmax = height[0]
        rmax = height[-1]
        
        while i <=j:
            # check lmax and rmax for current i, j positions
            if height[i] > lmax:
                lmax = height[i]
            if height[j] > rmax:
                rmax = height[j]
            
            #fill water upto lmax level for index i and move i to the right
            if lmax <= rmax:
                ans += lmax - height[i]
                i += 1
				
            #fill water upto rmax level for index j and move j to the left
            else:
                ans += rmax - height[j]
                j -= 1
                
        return ans
